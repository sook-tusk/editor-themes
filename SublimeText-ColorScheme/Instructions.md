# Overview

I had Stata syntax highlighting colour.
So I matched with that in Sublime Text 3, for seamless workflow.

Donwnload the file, **SK_Stata_markdown.tmTheme**.

# Where to save?

In Sublime, go to Preferences -\> Browse packages... and this should bring up the File Explorer window.
You're here: \> C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text \Packages\

From there, navigate further to `User`.
To easily identify my custom theme file in future, create a folder called `Mytheme`, and save the downloaded custom theme file, **SK_Stata_markdown.tmTheme**.

So, the full path will be:

> C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text \Packages\User\Mytheme\


# What's next?

In Sublime Text 4, go to the menu,

## Preferences \> Select Theme...

Set as Default.sublime-theme (already set as default. Leave as it is)

## Preferences \> Select Colour Scheme...

Start typing SK.
It'll bring the file.
Select **SK_Stata_markdown**

If the file name changes, Sublime will issue an error next time!
Calmly change the `Colour Scheme` in Sublime and restart Sublime.
The changes should take effect now.
